Description: magnify part of X display, with real-time updates
 Like xmag, xzoom magnifies a section of the X display. Xzoom is different
 because it will continuously update the magnified area as the display
 changes. It is fast enough to enlarge small animations, for example.
 .
 It can also mirror or rotate a part of the screen.
